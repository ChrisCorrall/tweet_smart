# tweet_smart
A tool for finding twitter influencers.
Please note this is very much in it's early stages! 

A basic tool that searches recent popular tweets for particular phrases, and then collects the usernames of those tweet's authors. 
The assumption being that people with popular tweets containing certain phrases are likely to be influencers within that sphere. 
You can set 'how popular' a tweet needs to be for it to count. 

I will add other features too in time:
1) Displaying and filtering by the number of followers a user has.
2) Searching user bios.
